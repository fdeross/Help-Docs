### Why make a product private?

There are several reasons why you might want to hide a product listing including:

- The product is seasonal.
- The listing is for a specific customer.  Ex: You have a client who is a real estate agent. He or she might order cookies for their an open house but they don't need a subscription and you want to be able to track sales of this item.  You might create a hidden product listing with a specific product image and even a special price. 
- Special Preorder.  You might run a special preorder for holiday cookies for your best customers.  You could hide the product from your Shop and just send the link to customers through text or email marketing.  You could do the same thing with people who follow your Facebook business page.
