        <p>Variable products provide specific options for the customer to choose from before adding the item to their cart. Variations can have the same price or can each be priced differently, and can also have their own SKUs, inventory, and photos. Each variation is basically a separate product.</p>

<h3 id="variable-products-vs-product-options">Variable Products vs Product Options</h3>
<p>Compared to Product Options, Variable Products are...</p>
<ul>
<li>More complex</li>
<li>Less flexible. Customers can only choose attributes that you add.</li>
<li>Works well if you want to offer only a narrow set of attributes.</li>
<li>Variable products allow shop managers to control inventory and to track sales for each attribute (but this adds more complexity).</li>
<li>You might consider using a variable product for a cake listing where you want to allow customers to select from different serving sizes and you want to be able to track the sales of each cake size.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="there-are-3-main-parts-to-variable-products">There are 3 main parts to Variable Products:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes:</strong> The heading for Attribute Options. Ex: Cake Flavor</li>
<li><strong>Attribute Options:</strong> The selectable options for the Variable Product. Ex: Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry</li>
<li><strong>Variations:</strong> The combination of Attributes and Attribute Options</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<h4 id="start-with-a-different-example">Start with a different example</h4>
<p>It maybe confusing with baked goods, so let's start with a totally different example: Let's imagine that you sold t-shirts.  You have 2 colors (white and tie-dye) and 3 sizes (small, medium, and large).  The set up would look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Color, Size</li>
<li><strong>Attribute Options:</strong> Color - White, Tie-Dye  Size - Small, Medium, Large</li>
<li><strong>Variations:</strong> Small White, Medium White, Large White, Small Tie-Dye, Medium Tie-Dye, Large Tie-Dye</li>
</ul>
<p>Customers could select <em>Color: White</em> and then select <em>Size: Large</em> and when purchased would reduce the inventory of the White Large by the quantity ordered.</p>
<h4 id="lets-now-bring-it-back-to-the-baking-world">Let's now bring it back to the baking world!</h4>
<p>You sell cakes and you want customers to be able to customize the cake.  Here's what that would look like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Cake Size, Cake Flavor, Cake Filling</li>
<li><strong>Attribute Options:</strong> Cake Size - 9in Single Layer Round, 12in Single Layer Round, 9in Double Layer Round Cake Flavor - Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry  Cake Filling - Buttercream, Strawberry, Raspberry</li>
<li><strong>Variations:</strong> 9in Single Layer Vanilla Buttercream, 12in Single Layer Round Vanilla Buttercream, 9in Double Layer Round Vanilla Buttercream, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dont-freak-out">Don't freak out!</h4>
<p>You maybe worried that you'll have to manually create each variation with all of the attributes. The variations that you want to focus on are the ones that change the price of the item. For cakes, that is probably only the <em>Cake Size</em>.  You would add a variation for each Cake Size where you adjust the price.  For the other Attributes you would leave the default option <em>Any Cake Flavor</em> and <em>Any Cake Filling</em>.  Customers will select a Cake Size which will change to the correct price and they can select any Cake Flavor and Cake Filling.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>This may seem intimidating at first and that is totally normal. Once you add your first 2 or 3 Variable Products, you will get the hang of it.  If you need help we are always here for you!</p>
