### Product Types

**Simple Product** - covers the vast majority of any products you may sell. Simple products are shipped and have no options.

**Grouped Product** - a collection of related products that can be purchased individually and only consist of simple products. For example, a gift box of cookies where the options are existing products you sell.

**Variable Product** - a product with variations, each of which may have a different SKU, price, stock option, etc. For example, a cake available in different serving sizes.

**Simple Subscription** - create and manage products with recurring payments — payments that will give you residual revenue you can track and count on.

**Variable Subscription** - Same as the Simple Subscription above, but with Variable Products

**Virtual** - a product that doesn’t require shipping. For example, a service. Enabling this, disables all shipping related fields. A virtual product will also not trigger the shipping calculator in cart or checkout.  You might use this for a gift certificate for a future cake decorating class.

**Downloadable** - activates additional fields where you can provide a downloadable file. After a successful purchase, customers are given a downloadable file as a link in the order email. This is suitable, for example, for a cookie cutter file that a baker can use with a 3d printer.
