Every product on Frosting has to have a Product Title. The Product Titles and Product Images are the **MOST** effective elements of the product listing.  It's what customers see under the product image on your shop page and will be the largest text on the product's listing.  Google and Facebook will use the Product Title as the main headline on search results and posts.

### Tips

Your Product Title should convey as much information about the product in as few words as possible.  It's a good idea to try to standardize your Product Titles so it will be easier for customers to quickly find the item they are looking for.

- Try to limit the Product Name to under 75 characters, including spaces. 
- Capitalize the first letter of each word.
- Don't include promotional phrases, such as “free shipping” or “100% quality guaranteed”.
- No decorative characters such as ~ ! * $ ? _ ~ { } # < > | * ; ^ ¬ ¦
