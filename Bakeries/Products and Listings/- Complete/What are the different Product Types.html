<h3 id="product-types">Product Types</h3>
<p><strong>Simple Product</strong> - covers the vast majority of any products you may sell. Simple products are shipped and have no options.</p>
<p><strong>Grouped Product</strong> - a collection of related products that can be purchased individually and only consist of simple products. For example, a gift box of cookies where the options are existing products you sell.</p>
<p><strong>Variable Product</strong> - a product with variations, each of which may have a different SKU, price, stock option, etc. For example, a cake available in different serving sizes.</p>
<p><strong>Simple Subscription</strong> - create and manage products with recurring payments — payments that will give you residual revenue you can track and count on.</p>
<p><strong>Variable Subscription</strong> - Same as the Simple Subscription above, but with Variable Products</p>
<p><strong>Virtual</strong> - a product that doesn’t require shipping. For example, a service. Enabling this, disables all shipping related fields. A virtual product will also not trigger the shipping calculator in cart or checkout.  You might use this for a gift certificate for a future cake decorating class.</p>
<p><strong>Downloadable</strong> - activates additional fields where you can provide a downloadable file. After a successful purchase, customers are given a downloadable file as a link in the order email. This is suitable, for example, for a cookie cutter file that a baker can use with a 3d printer.</p>

<h3>ℹ Info</h3>
