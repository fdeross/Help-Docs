**Simple** - covers the vast majority of any products you may sell. Simple products are shipped and have no options.

**Variable** - a product with variations, each of which may have a different SKU, price, stock option, etc. For example, a cake available in different serving sizes. [See: Variable Products vs Simple Products with Addons](#variable-products-vs-simple-products-with-addons)

**Group Product** - a collection of related products that can be purchased individually and only consist of simple products. For example, a gift box of cookies where the options are existing products you sell.

**Simple Subscription** - create and manage products with recurring payments — payments that will give you residual revenue you can track and count on.

**Variable Subscription** - Same as the Simple Subscription above, but with Variable Products

**Downloadable** - activates additional fields where you can provide a downloadable file. After a successful purchase, customers are given a downloadable file as a link in the order email. This is suitable, for example, for a cookie cutter file that a baker can use with a 3d printer.

**Virtual** - a product that doesn’t require shipping. For example, a service. Enabling this, disables all shipping related fields. A virtual product will also not trigger the shipping calculator in cart or checkout.  You might use this for a gift certificate for a future cake decorating class.

#### What is the difference between a Variable Product and a Simple Product with Addons
Both variable products with attributes and simple products with addons allow customers to customize a product to fit their needs, but there are some differences between the two approaches.  Here is a quick comparison.

#### Variable Products
Variable products allow customers to make customizations using attributes and values.  
Attribute = Cake Size      Values = 9 inch, 10 inch, 12 inch

- Complex to create variations and attributes
- Less flexible
- Works well for a few options
- Variable products allow shop managers to control inventory and to track sales for each Attribute (but this adds more complexity).  
- You might consider using a variable product for a cake listing where you want to allow customers to select from different serving sizes and you want to be able to track the sales of each cake size.

#### Simple Products with Addons
Addons also allow customers to customize items, but without the ability to track inventory or sales of specific addons.

- Very simple to create addons
- More field options like multi-choice, text boxes, dropdown selects, image upload, and headings
- Easily copy and paste addon code between items so you don't have to recreate addons for similar products
- Can't restrict addons by controlling inventory
- Can't track sales of individual addon options
- You might consider using addons for a cake listing where you want to allow customers to select from different serving sizes but you don't care about track the sales of each cake size and don't have a need to control inventory.
