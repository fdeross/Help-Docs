        <p><strong>Simple</strong> - covers the vast majority of any products you may sell. Simple products are shipped and have no options.</p>
<p><strong>Variable</strong> - a product with variations, each of which may have a different SKU, price, stock option, etc. For example, a cake available in different serving sizes. <a href="#variable-products-vs-simple-products-with-addons">See: Variable Products vs Simple Products with Addons</a></p>
<p><strong>Group Product</strong> - a collection of related products that can be purchased individually and only consist of simple products. For example, a gift box of cookies where the options are existing products you sell.</p>
<p><strong>Simple Subscription</strong> - create and manage products with recurring payments — payments that will give you residual revenue you can track and count on.</p>
<p><strong>Variable Subscription</strong> - Same as the Simple Subscription above, but with Variable Products</p>
<p><strong>Downloadable</strong> - activates additional fields where you can provide a downloadable file. After a successful purchase, customers are given a downloadable file as a link in the order email. This is suitable, for example, for a cookie cutter file that a baker can use with a 3d printer.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual</strong> - a product that doesn’t require shipping. For example, a service. Enabling this, disables all shipping related fields. A virtual product will also not trigger the shipping calculator in cart or checkout.  You might use this for a gift certificate for a future cake decorating class.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-the-difference-between-a-variable-product-and-a-simple-product-with-addons">What is the difference between a Variable Product and a Simple Product with Addons</h4>
<p>Both variable products with attributes and simple products with addons allow customers to customize a product to fit their needs, but there are some differences between the two approaches.  Here is a quick comparison.</p>
<h4 id="variable-products">Variable Products</h4>
<p>Variable products allow customers to make customizations using attributes and values.<br>
Attribute = Cake Size      Values = 9 inch, 10 inch, 12 inch</p>
<ul>
<li>Complex to create variations and attributes</li>
<li>Less flexible</li>
<li>Works well for a few options</li>
<li>Variable products allow shop managers to control inventory and to track sales for each Attribute (but this adds more complexity).</li>
<li>You might consider using a variable product for a cake listing where you want to allow customers to select from different serving sizes and you want to be able to track the sales of each cake size.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="simple-products-with-addons">Simple Products with Addons</h4>
<p>Addons also allow customers to customize items, but without the ability to track inventory or sales of specific addons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Very simple to create addons</li>
<li>More field options like multi-choice, text boxes, dropdown selects, image upload, and headings</li>
<li>Easily copy and paste addon code between items so you don't have to recreate addons for similar products</li>
<li>Can't restrict addons by controlling inventory</li>
<li>Can't track sales of individual addon options</li>
<li>You might consider using addons for a cake listing where you want to allow customers to select from different serving sizes but you don't care about track the sales of each cake size and don't have a need to control inventory.</li>
</ul>
