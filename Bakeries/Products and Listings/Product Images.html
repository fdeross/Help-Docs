        <p>Product images are the anchor of your product pages and ultimately determine whether customers choose to purchase ü•≥ (or not purchase üò¢) your items.  You don‚Äôt have to have a professional quality camera or years of experience to take professional looking pictures.  All you need is a decent phone, a couple of extra hours to experiment, and a few inexpensive tools.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-product-images-important">Why are Product Images important?</h3>
<p>When it comes to fresh food like baked goods, customers shop with their eyes first.  The more visually appealing your items look, the more you will sell.  People can process visual information 60,000 times faster than text and 90% of the information that comes to our brains visual.</p>
<p>üöÄ Sales:  67% of customers rank image quality as ‚Äúvery important‚Äù when making a purchasing decision.</p>
<p>ü§© Brand:  Your product images help tell your brand story and are usually a customer‚Äôs first impression of you.</p>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Natural light is better than artificial.  Try shooting next to a well-lit window or outside on a cloudy day.</li>
<li>Invest in a tripod for crisp, detailed shots.</li>
<li>Use a reflector or white foam board to fill in shadows or add more light.</li>
<li>Try to take all of your Featured Images from the same angle and distance to give different products a uniform look.</li>
<li>Simple and uncluttered backgrounds will make your items stand out.</li>
<li>Give your items some scale.  For cookies try holding one in your hand and for cakes try using a cake stand.</li>
<li>Listings on the Shop page will use a 3:4 ratio.  If you upload a square 1:1 image as your main image the system will crop the edges to make the image fit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="image-standards">Image Standards</h3>
<ul>
<li>Images must be of an actual item that you have made.  No stock photography.</li>
<li>Items must be in focus, well lit, color-accurate, and rotated correctly.</li>
<li>No watermarks on images or over products.</li>
<li>Pornographic or offensive materials are not allowed.</li>
<li>The items should take up 80% or more of the image.</li>
<li>The bakery or baker is responsible for securing the rights to use any copy written or trademarked materials</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="featured-image-standards">Featured Image Standards</h4>
<ul>
<li>All items must have a Featured Image.</li>
<li>The Featured Image should be a forward facing shot that shows the item in its entirety.</li>
<li>Featured (Main) images should only contain the items being sold and should not mislead or confuse the customer as to the quantity sold or items included.  If the listing is for half a dozen cookies, the featured image should only show 6 cookies. or If the listing is for a single cake, you should not show that item surrounded by other items like cookies.</li>
<li>The image should not contain additional text, watermarks, graphics, or borders.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="image-gallery-standards">Image Gallery Standards</h4>
<ul>
<li>Additional images are optional, but they are an excellent opportunity to show off your product‚Äôs details or how it would look in a stylized setting.</li>
<li>You can use items or objects to show scale or to give a stylized look.</li>
<li>Close up and detailed photos are allowed</li>
<li>You can add text to the image if it will help make their purchase.  Example: If you have one listing for multiple Christmas cookie packs you can add: Christmas Cookies  A, Christmas Cookies B, etc.  Make sure you use the same wording in the Options selection area.</li>
<li>You can include (and are encouraged to include) photos of your items incorporated in a display at a party or wedding.</li>
