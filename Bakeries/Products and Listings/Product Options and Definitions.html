        <p>The details you provide for a product affect the way the product appears to customers, make it easier for you to organize your products, and help customers find the product. You don't have to provide every detail for each product.</p>
<p>To make it easier to navigate, the definitions below are shown in the same order that they are listed on the Edit Product page.  Some options are only visible when you select a specific Product Type.</p>

<br>  
<h3 id="1-product-images">1. Product Images</h3>
<hr>
<h4 id="featured-image">Featured Image</h4>
<p>The main image that belongs to a product. This image will be shown first on the shop pages and is the large image shown on the product page. The Featured Image should be forward-facing and show the entire product.</p>
<p>Remember that customers shop with their eyes first.  A well lit, in focus, well-composed Featured Image on a clean background is the best sales driver.</p>
<p>Learn More: <a href="https://frosting.helpscoutdocs.com/article/150-product-images">Product Images</a></p>
<h4 id="image-gallery">Image Gallery</h4>
<p>Additional images that you use to show the product from different angles, up-close details, variations, or product scale.</p>
<h3 id="2-basic-product-information">2. Basic Product Information</h3>
<hr>
<h4 id="title">Title</h4>
<p>Every product listing has to have a name called the Product Title. The Product Title is what customers will see under the product image on your shop page and will be the largest text on the product's listing.  Google and Facebook will use the Product Title as the main headline on search results and posts.</p>
<p>Learn More: <a href="https://frosting.helpscoutdocs.com/article/149-product-titles">Product Titles</a></p>
<h4 id="product-type">Product Type</h4>
<p>The type of item being sold.</p>
<h4 id="price">Price</h4>
<p>The price the customer pays for the product. Please do not use commas or currency symbols.</p>
<h4 id="discounted-price">Discounted Price</h4>
<p>The promotional price used when you choose to run on sales. Please do not use commas or currency symbols.</p>
<h4 id="category">Category</h4>
<p>Categories are the primary way to group similar products. Some Product Categories have subcategories, too.</p>
<h4 id="tags">Tags</h4>
<p>Tags are another way to organize products. Contrary to categories, there is no hierarchy in tags; so there are no “subtags.”</p>
<h4 id="tax-category">Tax Category</h4>
<p>This is a seven digit code that automatically calculates sales tax.</p>
<h3 id="3-taxonomy">3. Taxonomy</h3>
<hr>
<h4 id="occasion">Occasion</h4>
<p>Special events that are not recognized national or religious holidays.</p>
<p>Example: Birthday, First Day of School, Wedding</p>
<h4 id="holiday">Holiday</h4>
<p>Dates or days of cultural, religious, or national significance that occur every year on or around the same date.</p>
<p>Example: Christmas, Halloween, Independence Day</p>
<h4 id="for-whom">For Whom</h4>
<p>Indicate whether this item is meant for a particular gender.</p>
<p>Example: Boy, Girl</p>
<h4 id="theme">Theme</h4>
<p>The overall design theme of the item.</p>
<p>Example: Super Heroes, Ghosts, Princess, Basketball, Over the Hill, Farm</p>
<h4 id="character">Character</h4>

<h4 id="sports-team">Sports Team</h4>

<p>Example: Arkansas Razorbacks, New York Yankees, Bentonville Tigers</p>
<h3 id="4-descriptions">4. Descriptions</h3>
<hr>
<h4 id="short-description">Short Description</h4>
<p>Short Descriptions help the customer understand the product with a simple, clear, and clean format.</p>
<h4 id="description-long-description">Description (Long Description)</h4>
<p>Include all relevant information that a customer would need, marketing content, and product highlights in paragraph form. For SEO purposes, repeat the product name and relevant keywords here.</p>
<h3 id="5-inventory">5. Inventory</h3>
<hr>
<p>The inventory section allows you to manage stock for the product individually and define whether to allow back orders and more.</p>
<h4 id="sku-stock-keeping-unit">SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)</h4>
<p>A unique code consisting of letters and numbers that can be used to identify and track a product and its inventory, or stock.  There is no set way to create a SKU, but bakeries will want to develop their own system that all employees follow and understand, so everyone stays on the same page.</p>
<h4 id="enable-product-stock-management---checkbox">Enable Product Stock Management - Checkbox</h4>
<h5 id="stock-quantity">Stock Quantity</h5>
<p>How many products you currently have in stock.</p>
<h5 id="low-stock-threshold">Low Stock Threshold</h5>
<p>Enter a number upon which the Shop Manager will be notified that in stock supplies are running out.</p>
<h5 id="allow-backorders">Allow Backorders</h5>
<p>Backorders are for products which are not in stock but will be there soon. This way you can still allow your customers to place orders for those products and then fulfill their orders as soon as the product is in stock.</p>
<h3 id="6-geolocation">6. Geolocation</h3>
<hr>
<p>Selecting 'Same as Store' means the product will have the same location as your store address. If you uncheck the 'Same as store' box then you can manually set an address for the product.</p>
<h3 id="7-booking">7. Booking</h3>
<hr>
<h4 id="booking---general">Booking - General</h4>
<h4 id="enable-booking">Enable Booking</h4>
<p><strong>Enabled</strong> - Makes the product bookable.<br>
<strong>Disabled</strong> - No booking options will be shown to the customer.</p>
<h4 id="booking-type">Booking Type</h4>
<p><strong>Only Day</strong> - Customers only need to select a date</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single Day</strong> - Customers can only select one date</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Nights</strong> - Customers can select multiple days</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Date &amp; Time</strong> - Customers need to select both a date and time</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed Time</strong> - Shop Managers can set a specific time period that customers can select.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="enable-inline-calendar">Enable Inline Calendar</h4>
<p><strong>Enabled</strong> - Calendar will always be visible to the customer on the Product Page. (recommended)<br>
<strong>Disabled</strong> - Customers will have to click on &quot;Select a Date&quot; to show a drop down calendar.</p>
<h4 id="purchase-without-choosing-a-date">Purchase without choosing a date</h4>
<p><strong>Enabled</strong> - Customers can purchase the product without choosing a date or time.<br>
<strong>Disabled</strong> - Customers are required to choose a date (&amp; time if necessary) before they can add the product to their cart. (recommended)</p>
<h4 id="requires-confirmation">Requires Confirmation?</h4>
<p><strong>Enabled</strong> - No payment information is collected at Checkout.  The Shop Manager must manually confirm the customer's order in the Shop Manager.  Once the order is manually confirmed by the Shop Manager, the customer can enter their payment information and send the payment.<br>
<strong>Disabled</strong> - Customers can add products to their cart, add payment information, and checkout as normal.  Orders are automatically confirmed and no further action by the customer or Shop Manager is needed.</p>
<h4 id="booking---availability">Booking - Availability</h4>
<p>This is the area where you set the order window (Minimum amount of time you need to fulfill an order &amp; the most amount of time you want customers to be able to order in the future.) and the days and time you are open.</p>
<h4 id="advanced-booking-period-in-hours">Advanced Booking Period (in hours)</h4>
<p>This sets the amount of time (in hours) between when a customer orders the product and the order's expected pickup/delivery time.  Keep in mind that each product can have its own Advanced Booking Period, so you might have products that you regularly stock like Chocolate Chip Cookies and that product could be set for a low Advanced Booking Period.  While a large custom cake might need a much longer Advanced Booking Period.</p>
<p>As an example: Let's say you set the Advanced Booking Period for a Cupcake 6 pack to 24 hours.  On Tuesday at 2pm a customer wants to order that 6 pack of cupcakes.  The soonest available time the customer could select would be Wednesday at 2pm.</p>
<p>The system will respect the bookable days of the week and times if you set them.  Let's take that same Cupcake 6 pack example, but the customer is ordering at 4pm on Saturday,but you are closed on Sunday and open on Monday at 8am.  In this example the soonest available time would be Monday at 8am.</p>
<p>Having an Advanced Booking Period ensures that customers avoid booking a product without the Shop Manager, Bakery, or Baker having enough notice to have the order ready.</p>
<h4 id="number-of-dates-to-choose">Number of dates to choose</h4>
<p>This is the maximum amount of days in the future that a customer can place an order.</p>
<p>As an example: You only want to let customers place orders no more than 3 months in advance.  In this example, you would set Number of dates to choose to 90.</p>
<h4 id="days-of-the-week">Days of the week</h4>
<p>You can enable or disable days of the week for customers to select from.</p>
<section class="callout-yellow">
<h3>🗒 Note</h3>
<p>All days are enabled by default. You must manually disable the days you don't want customers to select.</p>
</section>
<h5 id="maximum-bookings">Maximum Bookings</h5>
<p>Sets the maximum amount of the product that customers can buy on that day of the week.</p>
<h5 id="price-">Price ($)</h5>
<p>Charge a fee for each order that are picked up or delivered on that day of the week.</p>
<h4 id="set-availability-by-datesmonths">Set Availability by Dates/Months</h4>
<p>Enabling this option will give you the ability to easily restrict bookable dates for your product to a specific set of dates.</p>
<p>As an example: Let's say you own a pie shop and you are planning for the Thanksgiving holiday.  Your goal is to make sure your pies are eaten fresh (not a week old!), your employees are scheduled for when you'll be the busiest, and you want to be able to easily track who your holiday buyers are.  The easiest way to do this is to create a Thanksgiving Pie listing that limits when customers can pickup their orders.</p>
<h5 id="range-type">Range Type</h5>
<p><strong>Custom Range</strong> - Select more than one date in a row.<br>
<strong>Specific Dates</strong> - Select from individual dates.<br>
<strong>Range of Months</strong> - Select entire months<br>
<strong>Holidays</strong> - The Holidays option <em>excludes or blocks</em> dates from being able to be selected.</p>
<section class="callout-green">
<h3>💡 Tip</h3>
<p>1. You might be tempted to use the Holidays Range Type to exclude dates like Christmas Day for all of your products. This is not ideal because to change it, you would have to edit each product individually.  The best way would be to block dates using the Availability function under Bookings on the Shop Manager. 2. You should use Holidays Range Type with any other Range Type.</p>
</section>
<h5 id="bookable">Bookable</h5>
<p><strong>Enabled</strong> - Product can only be booked for the dates listed.<br>
<strong>Disabled</strong> - The Range Type and Dates are not enforced.</p>
<h5 id="max-bookings--no-of-years">Max bookings / No. of years</h5>
<p>The availability settings will be set to repeat for as many years as you select.</p>
<h4 id="set-weekdaysdates-and-its-time-slots">Set Weekdays/Dates and it's time slots</h4>
<p>If you selected Date &amp; Time as the Booking Type, then this section is where you will add the time slots.</p>
<h5 id="weekday">Weekday</h5>
<p>Set the day of the week for the time slot</p>
<h5 id="from--to">From / To</h5>
<p>Times that customers can choose from.</p>
<section class="callout-green">
<h3>💡 Tip</h3>
<p>Times must be in 24 hour format.  You must add a time in both the From and To time slots.
</p>
</section>
<h5 id="maximum-bookings-1">Maximum Bookings</h5>
<p>The maximum number of bookings that you will allow for that time slot.</p>
<h5 id="price-1">Price</h5>
<p>Charge a fee for each order that are picked up or delivered for that time slot.</p>
