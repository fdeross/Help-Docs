### What is Google Analytics?  

We insert a small snippet of code onto each page to allow Google Analytics to gather a wide variety of information, which can be divided into five categories:

**Real-Time:** Real-Time allows you to monitor activity as it happens on your store The reports are updated continuously and each hit is reported seconds after it occurs. For example, you can see how many people are on your store right now.
**Audience:** The Audience reports provide insight into characteristics of your users including demographics, device, and location.
**Acquisition:** The Acquisition reports provide a window how your users got to your site, their behavior on your site after they visit, and their patterns.
**Behavior:** The Behavior report visualizes the path users traveled from one page or Event (like Add to Cart) to the next. This report can help you discover what products your visitors view the most important. The Behavior Flow report can also help identify potential content issues.
**Conversions:** An advanced report to be used in conjunction with Google Analytics Goals, to track activity such as sales.
