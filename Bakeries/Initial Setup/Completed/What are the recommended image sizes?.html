<h3 id="store-banner">Store Banner</h3>
<p>Every bakery has a banner image at the top of the Shop Page. The banner is used as a background for your logo, bakery name, and some bakery info.  The easiest way to create a banner is to use this free Canva template <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/play?category=tACFalPUeCU&amp;type=TABQqsrpGTg">Click Here</a> . Banners display at 100% width on all devices.  You can change this photo out at any time by going to the <strong>Branding</strong> tab on your <strong>Shop Manager</strong> - <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>

<h3>ðŸ’¡ Tip</h3>
<p>To make things easier for you, we decided to use the same size banner as Etsy. Any Etsy banner template will work for Frosting.</p>
</section>
<p>Here are some things to remember about banners:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text overlays are not recommended.</li>
<li>Displays as a 4:1 ratio image.  If you use a larger image it will be cropped.</li>
<li>Minimum size is 1200 x 300px and the recommended size is 3360 x 840px.</li>
<li>Darker images show the overlay text better than light pictures.</li>
<li>Plain, less 'busy' images are less distracting to customers.</li>
<li>It's always a good idea to change your banner based on upcoming holidays.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="profile-picture">Profile Picture</h3>
<p>Your Store Icon is shown on your Shop Page and is usually your bakery's logo.  If you are a home baker then a Facebook style profile pic will work too.</p>
<p>Here are some things to remember about Icons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Displays as a 1:1 ratio image.  If you use a larger image it will be cropped.</li>
<li>Minimum size is 200 x 200px, but a 400 x 400px picture is recommended.</li>
<li>In lieu of a logo, you can also upload a product photo or other branding image.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="product-images">Product Images</h3>
<p>We use a 1:1 (square) ratio for Product Images.  If you upload other ratios it will be cropped.</p>
<h4 id="technical-requirements">Technical Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>JPEG (.jpeg/.jpg) or PNG (.png) format images</li>
<li>sRGB color mode</li>
<li>Cropped to 1:1 (square)</li>
<li>Resolution of up to 1500px in either length or width preferred.</li>
<li>500px in either length or width is the minimum resolution</li>
<li>File sizes larger than 5MB may encounter issues when uploading.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="standards">Standards</h4>
<ul>
<li>Images must be of an actual item that you have made.  No stock photography.</li>
<li>Items must be in focus, well lit, color accurate, and rotated correctly.</li>
<li>No watermarks on images or over products.</li>
<li>All sexually explicit, vulgar, or drug and alcohol themed images must be marked Adult Only.</li>
<li>The items should take up 80% or more of the image.</li>
<li>The bakery or baker is responsible for securing the rights to use any copy written or trademarked materials</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="featured-main-image">Featured (Main) Image</h4>
<ul>
<li>All items must have a Featured Image.</li>
<li>The Featured Image should be a forward facing shot that shows the item in its entirety.</li>
<li>Featured (Main) images should only contain the items being sold and should not mislead or confuse the customer as to the quantity sold or items included.  If the listing is for half a dozen cookies, the featured image should only show 6 cookies. or If the listing is for a single cake, you should not show that item surrounded by other items like cookies.</li>
<li>The image should not contain additional text, watermarks, graphics, or borders.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="additional-images">Additional Images</h4>
<ul>
<li>Additional images are optional, but they are an excellent opportunity to show off your productâ€™s details or how it would look in a stylized setting.</li>
<li>You can use items or objects to show scale or to give a stylized look.</li>
<li>Close up and detailed photos are allowed</li>
<li>You can add text to the image if it will help make their purchase.  Example: If you have one listing for multiple Christmas cookie packs you can add: Christmas Cookies  A, Christmas Cookies B, etc.  Make sure you use the same wording in the Options selection area.</li>
<li>You can include (and are encouraged to include) photos of your items incorporated in a display at a party or wedding.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is a good practice to leave some negative space between the item and the edge of the image.</li>
<li>Listings on the Shop page will use a 1:1 ratio.</li>
<li>You can upload any ratio image as your main image, but try to keep a consistent ratio for each product category and for each image in the listing.</li>
<li>Simple backgrounds will show off your items better.</li>
</ul>
