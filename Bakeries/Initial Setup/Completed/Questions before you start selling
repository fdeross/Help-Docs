By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail. - Benjamin Franklin  

Moving your bakery online can be a challenging and confusing journey. To help you, we have put together a list of questions that you should try to answer before you've even uploaded your first item. It is much easier to get your product listings right early than it is to go back and change tens or hundreds of items. Keep in mind that different product categories may have different answers.

You may have more than one answer to each question depending on the item's Product Category.  This is totally fine and normal.

Pricing is a process and one of the hardest parts of running a small business.  It's a good idea to establish consistent pricing for similar products in the same Product Category.  Customers are more likely to purchase from a bakery that has an easy to understand pricing structure.
