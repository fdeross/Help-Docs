Not everthing goes according to plan and sometimes you need to give a refund.  We have an easy two step process to start a refund.

### How to refund a customer order

1. Go to **Shop Manager > Orders**.
2. Find the order that you want to refund.
3. Click **Refund**.

4. Set the **quantity** of the product(s) that you want to refund.
5. Click **Refund**.
   
This will send a notification to Frosting to process a refund.  It is helpful if you add a refund note to explain the situation.  We will review the refund request and process it. Customers will receive an email confirming the refund.  It may take 2-3 business days for Stripe to reverse the transaction.
