There are two main ways that you will find out about a new order.

### Email

Bakers will receive a new order email as soon as a customer places an order on Frosting.  This is the main way that you will be notified of new orders. It is important to make sure that our email address, hello@frostingmarket.com, is added to your approved contacts. It is easy to test this when you place a test order when your shop is being set up for the first time.  The New Order Email will contain all the order information as well as a pdf order invoice that you can print for your records.

### Orders on Shop Manager

You can also check to see if you have new orders on the Shop Manager by going to the **Orders** page.
