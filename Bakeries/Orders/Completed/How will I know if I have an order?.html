        <p>There are two main ways that you will find out about a new order.</p>
<h3 id="email">Email</h3>
<p>Bakers will receive a new order email as soon as a customer places an order on Frosting.  This is the main way that you will be notified of new orders. It is important to make sure that our email address, <a href="mailto:hello@frostingmarket.com">hello@frostingmarket.com</a>, is added to your approved contacts. It is easy to test this when you place a test order when your shop is being set up for the first time.  The New Order Email will contain all the order information as well as a pdf order invoice that you can print for your records.</p>
<h3 id="orders-on-shop-manager">Orders on Shop Manager</h3>
<p>You can also check to see if you have new orders on the Shop Manager by going to the <strong>Orders</strong> page.</p>
