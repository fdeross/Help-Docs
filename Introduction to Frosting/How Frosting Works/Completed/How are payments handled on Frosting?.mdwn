Frosting uses a payment system that processes payments in a way that is flexible and secure for bakeries and customers.

### Payment Stages

1. Frosting calculates the total order price, taxes, and fees.
2. Customers enter their debit or credit card information during checkout and complete their order.
3. Frosting sends the order and payment information to Stripe.
4. Stripe sends the service fee and sales tax to Frosting and the remainder (minus card processing fees) goes to the bakery.

### What payment methods does Frosting accept?

We accept all major forms of credit and debit cards including: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, Diners Club, JCB, and UnionPay.  Transactions are processed by our payment processor [Stripe](stripe.com) in US Dollars.

### When will I receive my payout?

Payouts for bakeries are automatically deposited into the bank account you entered when you set up your Stripe account.  The first payout for new Stripe accounts may take up to 7 days to process and hit your account.  This delay allows Stripe to mitigate some credit risks and to conduct anti-money laundering check on accounts.  Subsequent payouts will be deposited in your account within 24 hours and up to 3 days depending on your sales volume.  You can always check your payout schedule by visiting [Stripe](stripe.com) and logging into your account.
