### Bakeries control their own

#### 1. Products:

Upload your item photos and set the tone with your product descriptions.

#### 2. Prices:

Set prices that you feel good about to help you achieve profit targets.

#### 3. Scheduling:

Block dates where you are full or unavailable.

#### 4. Policies:

Bakeries can set their own return and refund policies as long as they don't conflict with Frosting's policies.  Frosting will always be there to mediate.
