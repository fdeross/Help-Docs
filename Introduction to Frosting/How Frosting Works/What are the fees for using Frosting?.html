<p>We want to make Frosting as accessible as possible to creative entrepreneurs.  There are no joining fees, monthly fees, or listing fees and you have control over what you charge.  Bakeries only pay a low credit card processing fee of 2.9% + .30 cents.  We also take care of collecting and remitting sales tax on all purchases made through Frosting where required.  One more back-office task you donâ€™t have to worry about!</p>
<h3 id="customers">Customers</h3>
<p>We have a service fee that the customer pays for using the service.  This fee ranges from 9-13% allows us to run the site and provide support to customers and to you.  This fee is shown to customers during checkout, so there are no surprises.</p>
