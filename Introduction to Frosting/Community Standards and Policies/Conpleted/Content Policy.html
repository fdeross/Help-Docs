<p>Frosting provides a venue for buyers to discover and purchase from bakeries and home bakers. It is important to note that Frosting is not a part of that transaction.</p>
<p>By shopping on Frosting, you understand that:</p>
<p>You are not buying directly from Frosting, but from one of the many talented bakeries and home bakers on Frosting.<br>
Frosting makes every effort to pre-screen bakeries and bakers before they join, but does not pre-screen the products they sell.<br>
Each bakery and baker can have their own pickup, delivery, processing, and shop policies.<br>
You have the opportunity to leave a shop and product review, and you will abide by the <a href="https://frosting.helpscoutdocs.com/article/75-reviews-policy">Review Policy</a></p>
