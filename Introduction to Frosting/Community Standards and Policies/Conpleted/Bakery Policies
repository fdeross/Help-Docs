Bakeries are all unique businesses that have different policies and proceedures. It is best to be upfront with customers about your policies and proceedures. Remember that Frosting has it's own set of Policies that you can find on our Terms and Conditions page.

### Bakeries can set policies for the following:

#### Pickup, Delivery, or Shipping Policy

#### Refund and Cancellation Policy

If you choose to honor refund or cancellation requests, add the policy guidelines here. It helps to be as specific as possible with these policies.
