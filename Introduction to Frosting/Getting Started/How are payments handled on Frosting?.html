        <h3 id="what-payment-methods-does-frosting-accept">What payment methods does Frosting accept?</h3>
<p>We accept all major forms of credit and debit cards including: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, Diners Club, JCB, and UnionPay.  Transactions are processed by our payment processor Stripe in US Dollars.</p>
<h3 id="when-will-i-receive-my-payout">When will I receive my payout?</h3>
<p>The first payout for new Stripe accounts may take up to 7 days to process and hit your account.  This delay allows Stripe to mitigate some credit risks and to conduct anti-money laundering checks.  Subsequent payouts will be deposited in your account within 24 hours to 3 days depending on your Frosting sales volume.  You can always check your payout schedule by visiting <a href="stripe.com">Stripe</a> and logging into your account.</p>
