### Home Bakers

Many states allow home bakers to bake and decorate certain baked goods in their homes.  The laws are called Cottage Food laws and they allow certain home-based businesses to sell goods from their own kitchen to consumers.  The laws and regulations on what and how products can be sold vary from state to state and are constantly evolving.  Typically, a state's Department of Health or Department of Agriculture sets and oversees cottage food regulations.  Contact your state's Health Department or the Department of Agriculture for more details.
