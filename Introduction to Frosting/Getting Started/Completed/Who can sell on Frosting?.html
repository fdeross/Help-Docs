<p>Almost any commercial bakery can join Frosting and start selling online for free.  Any baked good or service that you offer at your brick and mortar bakery, you can sell on Frosting.</p>
<h3 id="home-bakers-or-cottage-bakeries">Home Bakers or Cottage Bakeries</h3>
<p>Many states allow home bakers to bake and decorate certain baked goods in their homes.  The laws are called Cottage Food laws and they allow certain home-based businesses to sell goods from their own kitchen to consumers.  The laws and regulations on what and how products can be sold vary from state to state and are constantly evolving.  Typically, a state's Department of Health or Department of Agriculture sets and oversees cottage food regulations.  Contact your state's Health Department or the Department of Agriculture for more details.</p>

<p>Frosting doesnâ€™t require sellers to have a business license to sell on Frosting Market.</p>
<p>However, when selling on Frosting you're required to follow any laws that apply to you as a bakery or cottage bakery selling online. If you have any questions regarding which laws apply to you, please contact a qualified professional.</p>
