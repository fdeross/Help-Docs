<p>
It's a good idea to create a $1 test item that you can use for testing.  You can keep this item hidden and only use it when you think there maybe an issue.

<h3 id="step-7-promote-your-new-online-bakery">Step 7. Promote your new online bakery</h3>
<p>Having a good marketing strategy is key to the success of selling online. Frosting is not a replacement for marketing tools like Facebook and Instagram.  It is a complement to them. We can help with promotion ideas, creating coupons, or designing in-store marketing materials.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some stuff you can try:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Promotion to incentivize customers.</li>
<li>Add a link to your Frosting Shop on Facebook, Instagram, and Google.</li>
<li>Attach a link to the product listing when you post on social media.</li>
<li>If you have an existing website, add a 'Shop Online' link in the header that points to your Frosting Shop.</li>
</ul>
