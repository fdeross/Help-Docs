### What payment methods does Frosting accept?
We accept all major forms of credit and debit cards including: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, Diners Club, JCB, and UnionPay.  Transactions are processed by our payment processor Stripe in US Dollars.

### When will I receive my payout?
The first payout for new Stripe accounts may take up to 7 days to process and hit your account.  This delay allows Stripe to mitigate some credit risks and to conduct anti-money laundering checks.  Subsequent payouts will be deposited in your account within 24 hours to 3 days depending on your Frosting sales volume.  You can always check your payout schedule by visiting [Stripe](stripe.com) and logging into your account.
