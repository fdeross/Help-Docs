**Here's some additional things we will need:**

- **Logo:** A logo and banner.
- **Staff:** Have the names and email addresses for employees that will need Staff accounts.
- **Price List:** You can send us a price list if you have one.

### Step 4. Set up billing and payments

### Step 5. Add products to your shop

We will create a few different products to get your Frosting Shop started.  These first products can be used like templates for future product listings.  You can always go to [Product Examples](https://frosting.helpscoutdocs.com/collection/85-product-examples) if you need help creating product listings.

### Step 6. Place a test order

By placing a test order, you can make sure that the checkout process works, taxes are set correctly, email notifications go to your email, and you are familiar the Frosting Shop Manager.  This also helps make sure that you receive your first payout as soon as possible.

<h3>ðŸ’¡ Tip</h3>
<p>
It's a good idea to create a $1 test item that you can use for testing.  You can keep this item hidden and only use it when you think there maybe an issue.

### Step 7. Promote your new online bakery

Having a good marketing strategy is key to the success of selling online. Frosting is not a replacement for marketing tools like Facebook and Instagram.  It is a complement to them. We can help with promotion ideas, creating coupons, or designing in-store marketing materials.

**Here are some stuff you can try:**

- Create coupons or discounts to incentivize customers.
- Add a link to your Frosting Shop on Facebook, Instagram, and Google.
- Attach a link to the product listing when you post on social media.
- If you have an existing website, add a 'Shop Online' link in the header that points to your Frosting Shop.
