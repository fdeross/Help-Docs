<p>By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail. - Benjamin Franklin</p>
<p>Moving your bakery online can be a challenging and confusing journey. To help you, we have put together a list of questions that you should try to answer before you've even uploaded your first item. It is much easier to get your product listings right early than it is to go back and change tens or hundreds of items. Keep in mind that different product categories may have different answers.</p>
<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What are your minimum and/or maximum order sizes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much time do you need between when a customer places an order and the pickup date to be able to reliably fulfill an order?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How far in the future do you want to allow a customer to place an order?</p>
</li>
</ol>
