Frosting has a lot of behind the scenes features to prevent fraud.

- We require customers to prove they are human when they sign up for an account to prevent bots from signing up.
- A phone number, email address, and address are all required before placing an order. Frosting and Stripe compare the billing address the customer entered on Frosting with the address on file with the credit or debit card and then references that with the location of where the customer placed the order from.  So if the fraudster entered all of the correct information but the order was placed in Russia, the order will get declined.  How cool is that?
- Stripe, our payment processor, uses sophisticated machine learning algorithms to catch fraudulent credit card charges.

Even with all of this technology things can still happen.  The best way to handle this is to follow these steps:

1. Contact the customer that placed the order directly to confirm that they placed the order.  The most secure way is by phone.
