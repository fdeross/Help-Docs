## Before you begin

When you share a link on Facebook, Pinterest, or Twitter, the social media companies use what's called Open Graph data to build the look of the shared content.

Here are some things to keep in mind

##### Facebook

**Title** - The postâ€™s title should be 40-50 characters.
**Description** - Descriptions should be limited to 200 characters.
**Image** - Should be 1200px x 627px and no bigger than 5mb to show correctly.

##### Twitter

**Title** - 70 character limit
**Description** - 200 character limit.
**Image** - Should be 1200px x 627px and no bigger than 5mb to show correctly.

One of our favorite sites for staying up-to-date on social media image specs is Sprout Social's [Always Up-to-Date Guide to Social Media Image Sizes](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/social-media-image-sizes-guide/).
