Selling Baking and Decorating Classes is a great way to acquire new customers and to show off your skills. You set up a Class Listing by setting the Product Type to Simple Product and checking the Virtual box.

Here are some ideas for classes you can offer:
Birthday parties, Decorating classes, Sip & Decorate parties, Business team building, Holiday-themed classes, Church and school functions.  You could even host a virtual decorating class on Zoom or Google Meet!
