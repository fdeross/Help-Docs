        <p>There are lots of reasons why you might want to hide or make a private product listing including:</p>
<ul>
<li>VIP Holiday Preorders to make sure your best customers get to order before you sell out.</li>
<li>Custom orders for a specific client like logo cookies.</li>
<li>If you want to temporarily hide a product but not delete it like holiday designs after the holiday has occurred.</li>
</ul>
<section class="callout-yellow">
<h3>ðŸ—’ Note</h3>
<p>Private Listings are still active and can be purchased if the product is in-stock and a customer has the direct URL. If you want to keep customers from placing an order then mark the product 'Out of Stock'.</p>
