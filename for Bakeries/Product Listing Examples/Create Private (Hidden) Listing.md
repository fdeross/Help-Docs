There are lots of reasons why you might want to hide or make a private product listing including:

- VIP Holiday Preorders to make sure your best customers get to order before you sell out.
- Custom orders for a specific client like logo cookies.
- If you want to temporarily hide a product but not delete it like holiday designs after the holiday has occurred.

<h3>ðŸ—’ Note</h3>
<p>Private Listings are still active and can be purchased if the product is in-stock and a customer has the direct URL. If you want to keep customers from placing an order then mark the product 'Out of Stock'.</p>
