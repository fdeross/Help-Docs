The Short and Long Descriptions are where customers go to get all the details about your item and your business. It is really important that you try to leave the customer without any questions after they read through your descriptions.

## Short Descriptions

Short Descriptions are the paragraph text between the buy box and the item price.  Item descriptions can be really hard, especially if you have hundreds of items!  It‚Äôs a good idea to have something unique to say about each item. In a pinch it‚Äôs also okay to use a default short description that is the same for all of your items.

Amazing job on every cake we‚Äôve ever taken to them! We never go anywhere else, they are the best all-around! We love this place. ‚Äì Chrisney

Ordered a tiered cake for a baby shower and it came out amazing. They were so helpful and responsive to my questions and requests PLUS the cake tasted amazing. Best bakery in NWA for sure! ‚Äì Donna

Easily the best wedding cake I‚Äôve ever had‚Ä¶ although I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm biased! üòâ Many guests commented on how delicious the cake and icing were. Highly recommend trying the strawberry ‚Äì it‚Äôs not my usual flavor of choice, but at the taste testing our families were convinced it was the best they‚Äôd had! ‚Äì Carly
