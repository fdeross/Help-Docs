        <p>The Short and Long Descriptions are where customers go to get all the details about your item and your business. It is really important that you try to leave the customer without any questions after they read through your descriptions.</p>

<h2 id="short-descriptions">Short Descriptions</h2>
<p>Short Descriptions are the paragraph text between the buy box and the item price.  Item descriptions can be really hard, especially if you have hundreds of items!  It‚Äôs a good idea to have something unique to say about each item. In a pinch it‚Äôs also okay to use a default short description that is the same for all of your items.</p>

<li>Item's details like size or servings.</li>
<li>If it‚Äôs a multipack, how many items are included?</li>

<h3>üí° Tip</h3>
<p>Spend a little extra time and write a solid Long Description that you can just copy and paste on all your product listings!</p>
</section>
<h3 id="long-description-recommendations-">Long Description Recommendations <!-- omit in toc --></h3>
<ul>
<li>Long Descriptions can be shared between similar items throughout your store.</li>
<li>Get your first item's Long Description perfect then use that to copy and paste to new items.</li>
<li>Include as much information about your item or business as you think the customer needs to make an informed decision.</li>
<li>Listings with more information do better on SEO.</li>
<li>You can even add links for things like your location or phone number.  When customers are on their phones this will bring up Google Maps or Apple Maps or start a call to your phone.</li>
<li>Ideas for Long Description sections: About Your Bakery (biography), Quality Statement, Pickup and Delivery Instructions, Storage Information, Allergy Warnings, Selection of Customer Reviews, or Serving Suggestions.</li>
</ul>

Amazing job on every cake we‚Äôve ever taken to them! We never go anywhere else, they are the best all-around! We love this place. ‚Äì Chrisney</p>
<p>Ordered a tiered cake for a baby shower and it came out amazing. They were so helpful and responsive to my questions and requests PLUS the cake tasted amazing. Best bakery in NWA for sure! ‚Äì Donna</p>
<p>Easily the best wedding cake I‚Äôve ever had‚Ä¶ although I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm biased! üòâ Many guests commented on how delicious the cake and icing were. Highly recommend trying the strawberry ‚Äì it‚Äôs not my usual flavor of choice, but at the taste testing our families were convinced it was the best they‚Äôd had! ‚Äì Carly</p>
