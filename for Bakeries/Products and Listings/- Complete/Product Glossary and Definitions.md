To make it easier to navigate, the definitions below are shown in the same order that they are listed on the Edit Product page.  Some options are only visible when you select a specific Product Type.

Learn More: [Product Types](https://frosting.helpscoutdocs.com/article/147-what-are-the-different-product-types)

#### SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)<!-- omit in toc --> 

A unique code consisting of letters and numbers that can be used to identify and track a product and its inventory, or stock.  There is no set way to create a SKU, but bakeries will want to develop their own system that all employees follow and understand, so everyone stays on the same page.

#### Private Listing

If you would like to hide this product from your Shop Page, check the box. This could be useful for products that you only want to enable for a specific amount of time like Christmas cookies or Summer cakes.  Customers can still get to the item if they have the direct URL.  This could be useful if you want to make a listing for a specific customer or if you have a private preorder.

#### Regular Price

The price the customer pays for the product. Please do not use commas or currency symbols. 

#### Sale Price

The promotional price used when you choose to run on sales. Please do not use commas or currency symbols. 

<section class="callout-red">
<h3>⚠ Warning</h3>
<p>Be sure to click the 'Schedule' link below the Sale Price box to set a From and To date. If you don't do this then the product will always be on sale.</p>
</section>

#### Tax Status

Is the product Taxable or not?  Usually it's better to leave this as taxible.

#### Tax Rate

If you charge sales tax, then select your bakery from the drop down.

## Subscription Settings 

<section class="callout-yellow">
<h3>🗒 Note</h3>
<p>If you selected Simple Subscription or Variable Subscription, you will see the options below on the General tab.</p>
</section>

![General - Subscriptions](https://ddxp4ty7t79c7.cloudfront.net/Help%20Scout%20Screenshots/Shop%20Manager/Products/SM%20-%20Products%20-%20Add%20Product%20-%20Item%20Specifics%20-%20General%20-%20Subscriptions.png =550x)

#### Subscription Price

- **Price**: What you want to charge for the subscription.
- **Billing Interval**: How often you want to charge.
- **Time Period**: Period of time to charge.

Example: Let's say you want to charge $15 every other week. You would select 15, every 2nd, week.  Want to charge every quarter? You would select 15, every 3, months.

#### Subscription expire after

The **Subscription expire after** field allows you to end a subscription after a predetermined amount of time. Subscriptions for subscription products with a value in this field have a maximum length, after which they expire and are no longer active.

Subscriptions for subscription products with **Never expire** set in the Expire after field can renew indefinitely as long as renewal payments are successful.

For example, consider a one year bread subscription, billed monthly, with a fee of $40/month. The length of the subscription would be 12 months and the billing period would be one month. In the subscription product details, this would be:

Subscription price: $40 every month
Expire after: 12 months

<section class="callout-green">
<h3>💡 Tip</h3>
<p>If you set the subscription to expire then you will depend on the customer to go through the process. You might want to leave the <strong>Subscription expire after</strong> option to <strong>Never expire</strong>.</p>
</section>

#### Sign up Fee

A sign-up fee is an amount that can be added to the beginning of a subscription.

This sign-up fee is in addition to any recurring amount that you have set for the subscription product. For example, if you create a subscription product for $75 per month with a $200 sign-up fee, the subscription’s initial total during checkout will be $275.

#### Free Trial

You can add a free trial period to the beginning of a subscription.

This period is added to any length you set for the subscription. For example, if you create a subscription of $5 per month for 6 months with a 1-month free trial period, the subscription will expire after 7 months.

When a subscription has a sign-up fee and no free trial period, the initial payment is the total of the sign-up fee and price per period. For example, a $5/month subscription with $10 sign-up fee will charge $15 for the first month. On the other hand, if a subscription has a sign-up fee and a free trial, only the sign-up fee is charged at the beginning of the subscription period. If there is no sign-up fee, nothing is charged at the beginning of the subscription period.

#### Limit Subscription

- **Do not limit** - Customers can sign up and cancel subscriptions and the free trial eligibility will reset.
- **Limited to one active subscription**: customers can only have one active subscription to this product at a time.
- **Limited to one of any status**: a customer can only sign up for the subscription once. If the customer cancels the subscription, he/she needs to resubscribe to the existing subscription by clicking the Resubscribe button next to the subscription on the My Account page.

The customer cannot purchase that subscription product again unless the existing subscription is trashed or permanently deleted by a Frosting. This feature ensures that each customer account only receives one free trial period to a product.

### Inventory <!-- omit in toc --> 

The inventory section allows you to manage stock for the product individually and define whether to allow back orders and more.

![Inventory Tab](https://ddxp4ty7t79c7.cloudfront.net/Help%20Scout%20Screenshots/Shop%20Manager/Products/SM%20-%20Products%20-%20Add%20Product%20-%20Item%20Specifics%20-%20Inventory.png =550x)

#### Manage stock? - Checkbox

- **Available Quantity**: How many products you currently have in stock.
- **Allow Backorders**: Backorders are for products which are not in stock but will be there soon. This way you can still allow your customers to place orders for those products and then fulfill their orders as soon as the product is in stock.
- **Low Stock Threshold**: Enter a number upon which you will be notified that in-stock supplies are running out.

<section class="callout-yellow">
<h3>🗒 Note</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that if your listing is for one item, you should set the dimensions for one item and the system will calculate the total weight and dimensions of the items purchased.</p>
</section>

### Weight<!-- omit in toc -->

## Booking <!-- omit in toc --> 

To let customers select dates for Pickup or Delivery you have to define the options.  The Booking tab is where all of that information is entered.

![Booking](https://ddxp4ty7t79c7.cloudfront.net/Help%20Scout%20Screenshots/Shop%20Manager/Products/SM%20-%20Products%20-%20Add%20Product%20-%20Item%20Specifics%20-%20Booking.png =550x)

<section class="callout-yellow">
<h3>🗒 Note</h3>
<p>To enable the Booking tab, you have to save the product first. After you have saved the product you will see all the options below.</p>
</section>

## Booking - General <!-- omit in toc --> 

#### Enable Booking<!-- omit in toc --> 

**Enabled** - Makes the product bookable.
**Disabled** - No booking options will be shown to the customer.

#### Booking Type<!-- omit in toc --> 

**Only Day** - Customers only need to select a date
- **Single Day** - Customers can only select one date

**Date & Time** - Customers need to select both a date and time
- **Fixed Time** - Shop Managers can set a specific time period that customers can select.

#### Enable Inline Calendar<!-- omit in toc --> 

**Enabled** - Calendar will always be visible to the customer on the Product Page. (recommended)
**Disabled** - Customers will have to click on "Select a Date" to show a drop-down calendar.

#### Purchase without choosing a date<!-- omit in toc --> 

**Enabled** - Customers can purchase the product without choosing a date or time.
**Disabled** - Customers are required to choose a date (& time if necessary) before they can add the product to their cart. (recommended)

#### Requires Confirmation?<!-- omit in toc --> 

**Enabled** - No payment information is collected at Checkout.  The Shop Manager must manually confirm the customer's order in the Shop Manager.  Once the order is manually confirmed by the Shop Manager, the customer can enter their payment information and send the payment.
**Disabled** - Customers can add products to their cart, add payment information, and checkout as normal.  Orders are automatically confirmed and no further action by the customer or Shop Manager is needed.

### Booking - Availability <!-- omit in toc --> 

This is the area where you set the order window (Minimum amount of time you need to fulfill an order & the most amount of time you want customers to be able to order in the future.) and the days and time you are open.

#### Minimum order notice (in hours)<!-- omit in toc --> 

This sets the amount of time (in hours) between when a customer orders the product and the order's expected pickup/delivery time.  Keep in mind that each product can have its own Minimum order notice, so you might have products that you regularly stock like Chocolate Chip Cookies and that product could be set for a low Minimum order notice.  While a large custom cake might need a much longer Minimum order notice.

As an example: Let's say you set the Minimum order notice for a Cupcake 6 pack to 24 hours.  On Tuesday at 2pm a customer wants to order that 6 pack of cupcakes.  The soonest available time the customer could select would be Wednesday at 2pm.

The system will respect the bookable days of the week and times if you set them.  Let's take that same Cupcake 6 pack example, but the customer is ordering at 4pm on Saturday,but you are closed on Sunday and open on Monday at 8am.  In this example the soonest available time would be Monday at 8am.

Having an Minimum order notice ensures that customers avoid booking a product without the Shop Manager, Bakery, or Baker having enough notice to have the order ready.

#### Maximum order ahead time (in days)<!-- omit in toc --> 

This is the maximum amount of days in the future that a customer can place an order.

As an example: You only want to let customers place orders no more than 3 months in advance.  In this example, you would set Number of dates to choose to 90.

#### Weekday<!-- omit in toc --> 
You can enable or disable days of the week for customers to select from.

<section class="callout-yellow">
<h3>🗒 Note</h3>
<p>All days are enabled by default. You must manually disable the days you don't want customers to select.</p>
</section>

#### Order Limit

Sets the maximum amount of the product that customers can buy on that day of the week. We recommend that you leave this blank.  If you need to control order limits you should use the **Manage Stock** option on the **Inventory** tab.

#### Price ($)

Charge a fee for each order that are picked up or delivered on that day of the week.

#### Set Availability by Dates/Months<!-- omit in toc --> 

Enabling this option will give you the ability to easily restrict bookable dates for your product to a specific set of dates.

As an example: Let's say you own a pie shop and you are planning for the Thanksgiving holiday.  Your goal is to make sure your pies are eaten fresh (not a week old!), your employees are scheduled for when you'll be the busiest, and you want to be able to easily track who your holiday buyers are.  The easiest way to do this is to create a Thanksgiving Pie listing that limits when customers can pickup their orders.

##### Range Type

**Custom Range** - Select more than one date in a row.
**Specific Dates** - Select from individual dates.
**Range of Months** - Select entire months
**Holidays** - The Holidays option *excludes or blocks* dates from being able to be selected. 

<section class="callout-green">
<h3>💡 Tip</h3>
<p>1. You might be tempted to use the Holidays Range Type to exclude dates like Christmas Day for all of your products. This is not ideal because to change it, you would have to edit each product individually.  The best way would be to block dates using the Availability function under Bookings on the Shop Manager. 2. You should use Holidays Range Type with any other Range Type.</p>
</section>

##### Bookable

**Enabled** - Product can only be booked for the dates listed.
**Disabled** - The Range Type and Dates are not enforced.

##### Max bookings / No. of years

The availability settings will be set to repeat for as many years as you select.

#### Set Weekdays/Dates and it's time slots<!-- omit in toc --> 

If you selected Date & Time as the Booking Type, then this section is where you will add the time slots.  

##### Weekday

Set the day of the week for the time slot

##### From / To

Times that customers can choose from.

<section class="callout-green">
<h3>💡 Tip</h3>
<p>Times must be in 24 hour format.  You must add a time in both the From and To time slots.
</p>
</section>

##### Order Limit

The maximum number of bookings that you will allow for that time slot.

##### Additional Fee

Charge a fee for each order that are picked up or delivered for that time slot.
