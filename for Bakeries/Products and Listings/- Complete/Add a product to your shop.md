#### Step 3. Item Photos

Every product is required to have a Featured Image.  The Featured Image is the main image that shows on all your listings.  You can also add additional images to the Product Gallery.  Images on the Product Gallery are shown below the Featured Image and customers can click on each one to see the details of your product.

- Click **Add a featured image**
- You can select an existing photo in your photo library or upload a new image.

#### Step 4. Product Details

- **Title** - A concise and relevant title will help customers find your product.
- **Categories** - Categories are the main way we organize items to help customers find what they are looking for.
- **Short Description** - The Short Description is shown at the top of the product listing below the Product Name. Try for 2-4 sentences that include keywords and specific information about this product. You should include any product information that customers might want to know about this product.
- **Long Description** - The Product Description is shown above the Product Reviews on the Description tab. You can use this area to introduce yourself, provide bakery information, allergy warnings, ingredient list, or awards you've received. Anything you feel like the customer would want to know about your bakery.  To help you move faster you might want to copy and paste the same Long Description for all of your items.
- **Product Options** - You can allow customers to personalize items by adding tags that enable that option on the Product Page.

#### Step 5. Product Tags & Keywords

- **Holidays** - Culturally or religiously significant dates like Easter, Halloween, Christmas.  Holidays typically fall on the same date every year.  If you notice that we have missed a holiday you can contact us to add it to the list.
- **Occasions** - Special events and social gatherings like Birthday, Prom, Wedding. Contact us if we missed an Occasion.
- **For Whom** - Is this specifically for a boy or girl? Leave blank if the item is gender neutral. As an example, you might select **Boy** for a baby shower cookie listing that was specifically for a Boy.
- **Themes** - Keywords that describe your design like Easter Egg, Diamond, Shark.  You can add Themes to the list.  Make sure to capitalize the first letter of each word.  
- **Character** - If your product theme includes any characters you can list that here.
- **Sports Team** - For a Sports Team themed item add or select the team.  Include the location and team name like Bentonville Tigers.
- **Specialty Diet** - Many customers have food allergies and require special diets and preparation.  You can help them find them find these items by selecting the tags.
- **Adult Content** - Not all items are family or kid friendly.  We require that any item that contains sexually explicit, vulgar language, or drug themes be checked as **Yes**. By checking Yes, customers will have to select the Show Adult Content option in the results.
  
#### Step 6. Item Specifics

- **Product Type** - The Product Type determines how your Product is shown to customers and what options you can select from.

- **General** - Depending on the Product Type you select, your options in the General tab change slightly. For the most part this is where you will set a SKU, Price, and Tax settings.
- **Inventory** - The inventory section allows you to manage stock for the product individually and define whether to allow back orders and more. It enables you to sell products and allow customers to add them to the cart to buy.
- **Linked Products** - Using up-sells and cross-sells, you can cross promote your products. They can be added by searching for a particular product and selecting the product from the dropdown list.
- **Attributes** - On the Attributes tab, you can assign details to a product. Once you have chosen an attribute from the select box, click add and apply the terms attached to that attribute.
- **SEO** - You can override the default SEO fields. We recommend that you leave this tab alone unless you know exactly what you are doing.
- **Variations** (only for Variable Products) - Variations tab let's you define variations of a single product where each variation may have a different SKU, price or stock level.
- **Shipping** - You can define the Weight and Dimensions of your product. This is useful to help you calculate shipping if you are shipping your product.
