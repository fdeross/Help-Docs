#### Simple Subscription

This is the same as a Simple Product, but the customer will be automatically be charged at intervals that you set for a period of time that you set.  You can think of it like a Netflix, Birchbox, or Dollar Shave Club but for your bakery.

#### Variable Subscription

A Variable Subscription allows you to set different options for the customer to choose from. Let's say you primarily bake bread and you want to offer several subscription options: Twice Weekly, Weekly, and Every Other Week.  You could set these as *variations* under one Variable Subscription.

#### Examples

##### Subscriptions to individuals 

- VIP memberships 👈🏼 This can be a huge money maker!
- Weekly bread delivery

##### Subscriptions for business and corporate clients 

- Cookies for waiting rooms like doctors, lawyers, dentists, banks, car dealerships
- Birthday Cakes for monthly corporate birthday parties.
- Logo cookies for businesses to send to clients and customers like mortgage brokers, realtors, insurance agents, salesmen.
