### When to use a Grouped Product

You would use a Grouped Product if you wanted to group multiple Simple Products or Subscriptions together under one listing.  Grouped Products are all about providing convenience for your customers and increasing sales for business.  You want to completely set up the Simple Products or Subscriptions that you add to your Grouped Product.

#### Examples

- A listing for weekly bread subscriptions
- A listing for classes where the customer can choose from different classes
- Multiple Cookie Kit options
- Multiple Holiday Cookie design opions

### Common Questions

#### Why would I choose a Grouped Product instead of a Variable Product?

A Grouped Product listing allows customers to select different quantities for each product that you grouped together.  So let's say you getting ready for Christmas and you are planning to make 3 Cookie assortments with 4 cookies each.

- **Christmas Cookie A**: Santa, Sleigh, Reindeer, Present, Santa Hat
- **Christmas Cookie B**: Mrs. Claus, Rocking Horse, Ball, Christmas Stocking
- **Christmas Cookie C**: Snow Flake, Candy Cane, Christmas Tree, Snow Man

You have two options:

1. Make 3 Simple Products and Group them as one Grouped Item *Christmas Cookies - 4pk*
or
2. Make 1 Variable Product and add each assortment as an Attribute Option under a *Select One* Attribute and create a Variation where customers could select any of the assortments.

**Option 1** is the best because it allows customers to add any mix of the cookie options and even different quantities of each.  A customer could select 2 of Christmas Cookie B and 3 of Christmas Cookie C.  Another customer could choose 1 of each. Someone else might want a dozen of Christmas Cookie A and they could easily add a quantity of 3 to their cart.  If you used the Variable Product customers would be limited to one assortment option only.
