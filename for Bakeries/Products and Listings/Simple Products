### When to use Simple Products

If you have a item that you don't want to offer a bunch of customizations for then simple products is your best bet.  Keep in mind Simple Products do not have variable options. You can still offer free [Personalization Options](https://frosting.helpscoutdocs.com/article/165-product-options) to customers.

#### Examples

- 1 dozen Chocolate Chip Cookies
- 9in German Chocolate Cake
- Valentine's Day Vanilla Cake Pops - 6pk
