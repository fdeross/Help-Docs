        <p>Variable Products offer the most powerful and customizable way to sell items on Frosting.  It is a little harder to setup a Variable Product vs a Simple one, but once you have done it once or twice you will get the hang of it.</p>

<h3 id="when-to-use-variable-products">When to use Variable Products</h3>
<p>Variable products provide specific options for the customer to choose from before adding the item to their cart. Variations can have the same price or can each be priced differently, and can also have their own SKUs, inventory, and photos. Each variation is basically a separate product.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>A cake design where customers can servings size, cake flavor, filling flavors, etc...</li>
<li>Offering a Gift Box option</li>
<li>Tiered pricing for higher quantity orders aka Popcorn Pricing</li>
</ul>
<p>With Variable Products you are really only limited by your imagination!</p>
<h3 id="3-key-components-of-variable-products">3 key components of Variable Products</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes:</strong> The heading for Attribute Options. Ex: Cake Flavor</li>
<li><strong>Attribute Options:</strong> The selectable options for the Variable Product. Ex: Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry</li>
<li><strong>Variations:</strong> The combination of Attributes and Attribute Options</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="lets-start-with-a-different-business-example">Let's start with a different business example</h4>
<p>It maybe confusing with baked goods, so let's start with a totally different example: Let's imagine that you sold t-shirts.  You have 2 colors (white and tie-dye) and 3 sizes (small, medium, and large).  The set up would look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Color, Size</li>
<li><strong>Attribute Options:</strong> Color - White, Tie-Dye  Size - Small, Medium, Large</li>
<li><strong>Variations:</strong> Small White, Medium White, Large White, Small Tie-Dye, Medium Tie-Dye, Large Tie-Dye</li>
</ul>
<p>Customers could select <em>Color: White</em> and then select <em>Size: Large</em> and when purchased would reduce the inventory of the White Large by the quantity ordered.</p>
<h4 id="lets-now-bring-it-back-to-the-baking-world">Let's now bring it back to the baking world!</h4>
<p>You sell cakes and you want customers to be able to customize the cake.  Here's what that would look like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Cake Size, Cake Flavor, Cake Filling</li>
<li><strong>Attribute Options:</strong> Cake Size - 8in Single Layer Round, 9in Double Layer Round, 10in Double Layer Round Cake Flavor - Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry  Cake Filling - Buttercream, Strawberry, Raspberry</li>
<li><strong>Variations:</strong> 8in Single Layer Vanilla Buttercream, 9in Double Layer Round Vanilla Buttercream, 10in Double Layer Round Vanilla Buttercream, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="hold-up-dont-freak-out">HOLD UP! Don't freak out!</h5>
<p>You maybe worried that you'll have to manually create each variation with all of the attributes. The variations that you want to focus on are the ones that change the price of the item. For cakes, that is probably only the <em>Cake Size</em>.  You would add a variation for each Cake Size where you adjust the price.  For the other Attributes you would leave the default option <em>Any Cake Flavor</em> and <em>Any Cake Filling</em>.  Customers will select a Cake Size which will change to the correct price and they can select any Cake Flavor and Cake Filling.</p>
<p>So variations would look like this:<br>
<em>8in Single Layer Round</em> $18.00 <em>Any Cake Flavor</em> <em>Any Cake Filling</em><br>
<em>9in Double Layer Round</em> $35.00 <em>Any Cake Flavor</em> <em>Any Cake Filling</em><br>
<em>10in Double Layer Round</em> $51.00 <em>Any Cake Flavor</em> <em>Any Cake Filling</em></p>
