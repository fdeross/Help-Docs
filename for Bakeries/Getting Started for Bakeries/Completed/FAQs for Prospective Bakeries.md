- **Scheduling:** Set minimum order times and maximum days out for customer to choose, so you are always in control of your schedule.
- **Policies:** Bakeries can set their own return and refund policies as long as they don't conflict with Frosting's policies.  Frosting will always be there to mediate.

## I'm worried about getting overwhelmed with orders

This is a common concern many bakers have. We know you can only handle a certain amount of orders at a time, and we built multiple ways to control how many orders you receive so you don't get overwhelmed. 

- **Min order notification time:** No surprise orders! Set the amount of time between when a customer orders and the order is expected to be ready for pickup or delivery.
- **Max future dates to order:** Set how far in the future you are willing to take orders for each product.
- **Stock Management:** You can set the exact amount of orders that you will accept for each product.
- **Order Confirmation:** Bookable products can be set so that you can approve each order before the customer is charged.

## When do I get paid?

Payouts for bakeries are automatically deposited into the bank account you entered when you set up your Stripe account.  The first payout for new Stripe accounts may take up to 7 days to process and hit your account.
