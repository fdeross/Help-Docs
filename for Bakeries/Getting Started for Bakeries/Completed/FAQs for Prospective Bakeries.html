<h2 id="what-is-frosting">What is Frosting?</h2>
<p>Frosting is a community marketplace that allows customers to conveniently buy custom cakes, cookies, and other sweet treats from local bakeries and bakers online.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-frosting-help-my-bakery">How can Frosting help my bakery?</h2>
<p>Studies have shown that customers spend more and shop more often if it is convenient. Frosting helps bakeries by reducing the friction of ordering custom cakes, cookies, and baked goods. With Frosting customers can serve themselves by conveniently placing an order anytime, anywhere, and from any device.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-does-it-cost-to-join">How much does it cost to join?</h2>
<p>$0, Nada, Free.  We want to give access to as many bakeries as possible and to do that we don't charge a fee to join.</p>

<h4 id="bakeries-">Bakeries <!-- omit in toc --></h4>
<p>We want to make Frosting as accessible as possible to creative entrepreneurs. Joining Frosting, creating your shop, and listing items are all free, plus you have freedom over what you charge.  There are two basic fees for bakeries: a 5% transaction fee on the total sale price (you keep 95%) and Stripe’s payment processing fee of 2.9% + $.30. We also take care of collecting and remitting sales tax on all purchases made through Frosting where required.  One more back-office task you don’t have to worry about!</p>
<h4 id="customers-">Customers <!-- omit in toc --></h4>
<p>We have a service fee that the customer pays for using the service.  This fee ranges from 9-13% allows us to run the site and provide support to customers and to you.  This fee is shown to customers during checkout, so there are no surprises.</p>
<h2 id="who-can-sell-on-frosting">Who can sell on Frosting?</h2>
<h4 id="retail-bakeries-">Retail Bakeries <!-- omit in toc --></h4>
<p>Almost any commercial bakery can join Frosting and start selling online for free.  Any baked good or service that you offer at your brick and mortar bakery, you can sell on Frosting.</p>
<h4 id="home-bakers-or-cottage-bakeries-">Home Bakers or Cottage Bakeries <!-- omit in toc --></h4>
<p>Many states allow home bakers to bake and decorate certain baked goods in their homes.  The laws are called Cottage Food laws and they allow certain home-based businesses to sell goods from their own kitchen to consumers.  The laws and regulations on what and how products can be sold vary from state to state and are constantly evolving.  Typically, a state's Department of Health or Department of Agriculture sets and oversees cottage food regulations.  Contact your state's Health Department or the Department of Agriculture for more details.</p>
<h4 id="regulations-">Regulations <!-- omit in toc --></h4>
<p>Frosting doesn’t require sellers to have a business license to sell on Frosting Market.</p>
<p>However, when selling on Frosting you're required to follow any laws that apply to you as a bakery or cottage bakery selling online. If you have any questions regarding which laws apply to you, please contact a qualified professional.</p>

<li><strong>Prices:</strong> Set prices that you feel good about to help you achieve profit targets.</li>
<li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Set minimum order times and maximum days out for customer to choose, so you are always in control of your schedule.</li>
<li><strong>Policies:</strong> Bakeries can set their own return and refund policies as long as they don't conflict with Frosting's policies.  Frosting will always be there to mediate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="im-worried-about-getting-overwhelmed-with-orders">I'm worried about getting overwhelmed with orders</h2>
<p>This is a common concern many bakers have. We know you can only handle a certain amount of orders at a time, and we built multiple ways to control how many orders you receive so you don't get overwhelmed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Min order notification time:</strong> No surprise orders! Set the amount of time between when a customer orders and the order is expected to be ready for pickup or delivery.</li>
<li><strong>Max future dates to order:</strong> Set how far in the future you are willing to take orders for each product.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Management:</strong> You can set the exact amount of orders that you will accept for each product.</li>
<li><strong>Order Confirmation:</strong> Bookable products can be set so that you can approve each order before the customer is charged.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-there-any-requirements-to-join">Are there any requirements to join?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be based in the United States</li>
<li>Have a bank account</li>
<li>Have verifiable baking or decorating experience</li>
<li>Completed all the registrations and obtained the licenses and permits required in your local jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-i-sign-up">How do I sign up?</h2>
<p>Start with our quick 5 minute <a href="https://bakeryapplication.paperform.co/">Bakery Application Form</a>. We will contact you once we have reviewed your application.</p>
<h2 id="when-do-i-get-paid">When do I get paid?</h2>
<p>Payouts for bakeries are automatically deposited into the bank account you entered when you set up your Stripe account.  The first payout for new Stripe accounts may take up to 7 days to process and hit your account.  This delay allows Stripe to mitigate some credit risks and to conduct anti-money laundering check on accounts.  Subsequent payouts will be deposited in your account within 24 hours and up to 3 days depending on your sales volume.  You can always check your payout schedule by visiting <a href="stripe.com">Stripe</a> and logging into your account.</p>
