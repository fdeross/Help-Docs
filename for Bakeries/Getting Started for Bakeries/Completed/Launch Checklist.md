Moving your bakery online can be a challenging and confusing journey. To help you, we have put together a list of questions that you should try to answer before uploading your first item. It is much easier to get your product listings right early than it is to go back and change tens or hundreds of items.

You may have more than one answer to each question depending on the item's Product Category. This is totally fine and normal.

## Figure out your 'Order Window'

The **Order Window** is the time between the **Minimum order notice** and **Maximum order ahead time**.  For example, you might want a minimum 24 hour notice but don't want to take any orders more than 90 days in advance.  Super easy and you can set this for each product!

- How much lead time do you need between when a customer places an order and when the order is ready for pickup/delivery?  Lot's of your items won't be on hand for immediate pickup. You need time to bake and decorate them. We call this the **Minimum order notice** and customers won't be able to place an order before this time.
- How far in the future do you want customers to be able to order? This can vary from category to category. For Wedding cakes, you might want to take orders a year in advance, but you probably don't want someone ordering cookies more than 4-6 months in advance.  This is called the **Maximum order ahead time**.

## How will customers get their orders?

### Order Pickups <!-- omit in toc -->

Order Pickup is the default option for all bakers who sell on Frosting.  It may seem like a simple process, but customers might have questions especially if you are a home baker and only offer porch pickup or prefer to do pickups at a farmers market.

- What is the process and location for order pickups?
- What days of the week do you offer pickups?
- What are your pickup times?

Include this information in your Policies or on the product's Long Description.

### Local Delivery <!-- omit in toc -->

- Do you offer delivery?
- Is there a delivery fee?
- Do you offer free delivery over a certain amount?
- How far will you deliver an order?

This may sound complicated but we have made is super easy. [Learn more](https://frosting.helpscoutdocs.com/article/186-about-pickup-delivery-and-shipping)

## Add Your Products

### Products <!-- omit in toc -->

- Do you have a minimum and/or maximum order sizes? You should have an idea of the minimum order size that you want to list on Frosting. It's probably not worth your time to sell a single donut. Instead, list minimums at 1 dozen or if you sell fancy donuts list them as 6pks.
- How much customization do you want to allow customers to make to a product? When you upload a cake design do you want the customer to be able to pick from different cake sizes or do you want to sell just one size?  Can the customer add a written inscription to certain items?

<h3>ðŸ’¡ Tip</h3>
<p>Your first products should be what you are selling for the closest upcoming holiday. Don't try and upload everything at once. Take it bite by bite.</p>
</section>
  
### Pricing <!-- omit in toc -->

Pricing is a process and one of the hardest parts of running a small business. It's a good idea to establish consistent pricing for similar products in the same Product Category. If you are a cookier, you know that different designs take different amounts of time to decorate and you might have different size cookies, too. That's totally ok! Customers are more likely to purchase from a bakery that has an easy to understand pricing structure.

<h3>ðŸ’¡ Tip</h3>
<p>With Frosting you can even set up products to take advantage of popcorn pricing and volume pricing.</p>

### Images <!-- omit in toc -->

Customers shop with their eyes first and quality product images sell. [Learn more](https://frosting.helpscoutdocs.com/article/150-product-images)

- If you haven't already start developing a consistent look for all your product images.
- Always take pictures of your items before you've handed them off to the customer.
- It's ok to ask customers to send you pictures of the items at a party or set up at a wedding.
- Give your products some scale by including other objects in the images.
