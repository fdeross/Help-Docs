What happens once I've been accepted?

Congratulations and welcome to the Abound community! Our acceptance criteria are strict, so give yourself a pat on the back for building an incredible brand. We're thrilled to have you with us!

Once you've been accepted, you'll receive an email from us welcoming you along with a link to get started. Once you get started, you'll be walked through creating your account and adding your brand info. This takes about 5 minutes and you'll input some basic information about your brand.

After you've added your brand info, you'll have access to your Abound account. From there, you'll see a checklist on your dashboard guiding you through the remaining steps to launch your shop, which includes setting up your shop, adding your products, and setting your payout preferences.
