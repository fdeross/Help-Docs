        <p>Credit and debit card processors like Stripe charge a fee to use their service.  This fee gets split between Stripe, the card network (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, etc), and the banks.  Frosting has no control over these fees and we do everything we can to keep them low.</p>
<p>You can learn more about Stripe's processing fee: <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing">Stripe Pricing</a></p>
