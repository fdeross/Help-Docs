<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>There are several parts that make up fees on Frosting and Stripe.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost of Products</strong>: This is the base cost that a baker sets when creating an item.  It could be increased by Variations or quantity or it could be decreased by a sale price or Promotion.</li>
<li><strong>Promotion</strong>: If you create a promo code and the customer uses it, this will decrease the price of the order or item.</li>
<li><strong>Shipping</strong>: Pickups are free for customers but you might have other shipping costs for Local Delivery or mail shipping.</li>
<li><strong>Tax</strong>: If your jurisdiction charges sales tax you will add this to your order.</li>
<li><strong>Order Total</strong>: Product, shipping, and sales taxes.</li>
<li><strong>Charged Amount</strong>: Order total plus Frosting's Service fee.  This is the amount passed to Stripe.</li>
<li><strong>Payout</strong>: This is the amount that Stripe will deposit into your account.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="service-fee">Service Fee</h2>
<p>Let's break down how we come up with the Service Fee.</p>
<h4 id="order-total">Order Total</h4>
<p>Order Total = ((Cost of Products - Promotion) + Shipping) + Tax</p>
<h4 id="charged-amount">Charged Amount</h4>
<p>Customers pay a service fee for using Frosting.  This service fee ranges from 9 - 13% of the Total Price.</p>
<p>Charged Amount = Order Total + Service Fee</p>
<h4 id="bakery-commission">Bakery Commission</h4>
<p>We want to help as many small business owners as we can so we are waving the commission till June 2021.  Normally bakery's get a 95% commission.</p>
<h2 id="stripe-transaction-fee">Stripe transaction fee</h2>
<p>Payout = (Charged Amount - 2.9%) - .30</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>This looks complicated, so let's take an example.</p>
<p>Let's say your bakery is here in Bentonville and you sell a cake for $25.  The customer wants local delivery which you charge $5 for. To further complicate things you are giving 10% off for your top customers.</p>
<p>Cost of Products: $25<br>
Promotion: -10%<br>
Tax Rate: 9.5%<br>
Shipping: $5<br>
Service Fee: 9%</p>
<p>Cost of Products - Promotion = A<br>
$25 - 10% [$2.50] = $22.50</p>
<p>A + Shipping = B<br>
$22.50 + $5 = $27.50</p>
<p>B + Tax = Order Total<br>
$27.50 + 9.5% [$2.61] = $30.11</p>
<p>Order Total + Service Fee = Charged Amount<br>
$30.11 + 9% [$2.71] = $32.82</p>
<p>Order Total = $30.11</p>
<p>Charged Amount = $32.82</p>
<h5 id="now-to-stripe-and-the-payout">Now to Stripe and the Payout</h5>
<p>$32.82 - 2.9%</p>
<p>($25 - 2.9% [.73])</p>
<p>$24.27 - .30 = $23.97</p>
<p>The bakery's payout would be $23.97</p>
