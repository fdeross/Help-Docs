To help Frosting run smoothly and to cover the costs of the services we provide, we charge a service fee when an order is placed.

## Service Fee

We have a split-fee system where the Service fee is shared between the customer and baker. A service fee is deducted from the bakery payout, and a service fee is charged to guests.

#### Bakeries

We want to make Frosting as accessible as possible to creative entrepreneurs. Joining Frosting, creating your shop, and listing items are all free, plus you have freedom over what you charge.  There are two basic fees for bakeries: a 5% transaction fee on the total sale price (you keep 95%) and Stripe’s payment processing fee of 2.9% + $.30. We also take care of collecting and remitting sales tax on all purchases made through Frosting where required.  One more back-office task you don’t have to worry about!

#### Customers

We have a service fee that the customer pays for using the service.  This fee ranges from 9-13% allows us to run the site and provide support to customers and to you.  This fee is shown to customers during checkout, so there are no surprises.
