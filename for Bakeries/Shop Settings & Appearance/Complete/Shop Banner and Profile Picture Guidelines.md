## Before you begin

#### Shop Banner and Profile Pictures on the Shop Page

## Shop Banner

Every bakery has a banner image at the top of the Shop Page. The banner is used as a background for your logo, bakery name, and some bakery info.  

The easiest way to create a banner is to use our FREE Canva template. This template is best viewed on a desktop computer.

#### How to add or edit the Shop Banner

1. Go to **Shop Manager > Settings**.
2. Click on the **Branding** tab.
3. If you don't have a Shop Banner click **Add Shop Banner**.
4. If you are changing the Shop Banner, you must first click **Remove Shop Banner** then upload a new one.  

#### Shop Banner Guidelines

- Text overlays are not recommended.
- Displays as a 4:1 ratio image.  If you use a larger image it will be cropped to the top of the image.
- Banners display at 100% width on all devices.
- Minimum size is 1200 x 300px and the recommended size is 3360 x 840px.
- Darker images show the overlay text better than light pictures.
- Plain, less 'busy' images are less distracting to customers.
- It's always a good idea to change your banner based on upcoming holidays.

<h3>ðŸ’¡ Tip</h3>
<p>To make things easier for you, we decided to use the same size banner as Etsy. Any Etsy banner template will work for Frosting.</p>

## Profile Picture

Your Profile Picture is shown on your Shop Page and is usually your bakery's logo.  If you are a home baker then a Facebook style profile pic will work too.

We also created a FREE Canva Profile Picture template. This template is best viewed on a desktop computer. [**Frosting Profile Picture**](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEYYdB1uj0/b9Dfz64Snol-flt0egP5lw/view?utm_content=DAEYYdB1uj0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton&mode=preview)

#### How to add or edit the Profile Picture

1. Go to **Shop Manager > Settings**.
2. Click on the **Branding** tab.
3. If you don't have a Profile Picture click **Add Profile Picture**.
4. If you are changing the Profile Picture, you must first click **Remove Profile Picture** then upload a new one.

#### Profile Picture Guidelines

- Displays as a 1:1 ratio image.  If you use a larger image it will be cropped.
- Minimum size is 200 x 200px, but a 400 x 400px picture is recommended.
- In lieu of a logo, you can also upload a product photo or other branding image.  

## Standards

- The bakery or baker is responsible for securing the rights to use any copywritten or trademarked materials.
- No sexually explicit or adult content including language.

## Technical Requirements

- JPEG (.jpeg/.jpg) or PNG (.png) format images
- sRGB color mode
- File sizes larger than 5MB may encounter issues when uploading.

## Best Practices
