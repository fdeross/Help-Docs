## Shop Banner

Every bakery has a banner image at the top of the Shop Page. The banner is used as a background for your logo, bakery name, and some bakery info.  The easiest way to create a banner is to use this free Canva template [Click Here](https://www.canva.com/design/play?category=tACFalPUeCU&type=TABQqsrpGTg) . Banners display at 100% width on all devices.

#### Shop Banner Guidelines

- Text overlays are not recommended.
- Displays as a 4:1 ratio image.  If you use a larger image it will be cropped to the top of the image.
- Minimum size is 1200 x 300px and the recommended size is 3360 x 840px.
- Darker images show the overlay text better than light pictures.
- Plain, less 'busy' images are less distracting to customers.
- It's always a good idea to change your banner based on upcoming holidays.

#### How to add or edit the Shop Banner

2. Click on the **Branding** tab.
3. If you don't have a Shop Banner click **Add Shop Banner**.
